        How Arbitrage Betting Works:
      </Heading>
      <Text fontSize="md" mb={4} color="gray.600">
        To calculate arbitrage opportunities, you need to compare the odds for different outcomes of a game. For example, if one bookmaker offers a better price for the "Over" on assists and another for the "Under", combining these bets creates an arbitrage opportunity. Here's how it's calculated:

          <strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify the markets with differing odds from multiple bookmakers.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <strong>Step 2:</strong> Calculate the implied probability of each outcome using the odds.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <strong>Step 3:</strong> Place bets on each outcome in such a way that your combined stakes guarantee a profit regardless of the result.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <strong>Step 4:</strong> Lock in your profits by betting on all potential outcomes of the game, ensuring your risk is minimized.
